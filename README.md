### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front and backend developer with a lot of experience with experimental code, greenfield projects, making tools for others to use, sharing information, I also like to document my findings and aim to slowly move everything to Github to help others as it has helped me. I will write a lot of proof of concept code in PHP as I am most familiar with it and maybe one day port it to something else.
